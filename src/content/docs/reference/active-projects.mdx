At the time of writing, Simmons Tech is working on a large-scale overhaul of tech infrastructure here. This includes getting a new server, creating a new frontend from the Simmons website and DB, and creating a new backend to handle all of the data. This is a huge project and will take a lot of time and effort to complete. If you are interested in helping out, please [reach out to the Tech Chair](mailto:simmons-tech-chair@mit.edu) or [join the IT Comm mailing list](https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/simmons-it-comm)!
