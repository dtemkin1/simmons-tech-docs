You have to manually add new people to certain mailing lists like `simmons-announce`. You can do this at [MIT's Mailman dashboard](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/admin/simmons-announce-remake) (the password is also in the passwords spreadsheet).

**Note that simmons-announce is on mailman as simmons-announce-remake.**
