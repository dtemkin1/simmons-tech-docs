<Steps>

1.  First, SSH into your personal Athena dialup thing. The password is your kerb password

    ```sh
    ssh <KERB>@athena.dialup.mit.edu
    ```

2.  In your personal Athena dialup thing, SSH into `root@simmons.mit.edu`. If it's your first time, enter the password at the top of the Simmons Tech Passwords spreadsheet.

    ```sh
    ssh root@simmons.mit.edu
    ```

3.  To avoid typing in the password in future, add your kerb to the file `/root/.k5login`. Add both `<KERB>@ATHENA.MIT.EDU` and `<KERB>/root@ATHENA.MIT.EDU`.

</Steps>
