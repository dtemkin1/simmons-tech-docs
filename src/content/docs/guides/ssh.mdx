First, SSH into your personal Athena dialup thing

```bash
ssh <KERB>@athena.dialup.mit.edu
```

<Aside>The password is your kerb password</Aside>

In your personal Athena dialup thing, SSH into `root@simmons.mit.edu`

```bash
ssh root@simmons.mit.edu
```

<Aside>
  If it's your first time, enter the password at the top of the Simmons Tech
  Passwords spreadsheet
</Aside>

To avoid typing in the password in future, add your kerb to the file `/root/.k5login`. Add both `<KERB>@ATHENA.MIT.EDU` and `<KERB>/root@ATHENA.MIT.EDU`.
