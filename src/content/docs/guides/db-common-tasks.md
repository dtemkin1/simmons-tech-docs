## Giving yourself permissions on the DB

Go to <https://simmons.mit.edu/sds/administrators/> and click "add to group".

## Adding people to the DB

Go to <https://simmons.mit.edu/sds/rac/add.php> and enter their information.

To edit existing users, go to the directory (<https://simmons.mit.edu/sds/directory/>), search for them, and click the "modify \<kerb\> link" under "RAC commands". If you don't see this link, you probably don't have the relevant permissions on the DB yet.
